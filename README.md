# spotify_clone
This is a spotify clone using only HTML5 and CSS 

As a front-end developer, I wanted to challenge myself to recreate the iconic Spotify interface using HTML and CSS. This mini project is a simplified version of the popular music streaming platform, featuring a responsive design and interactive elements.

Key Features:
Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices
Custom-designed UI components, including navigation bars, playlists, and track cards
Interactive elements, such as hover effects and button animations
A functional search bar that filters tracks based on user input

Technologies Used:
HTML5 for structuring and content organization
CSS3 for styling and layout
CSS Flexbox and Grid for responsive design

What I Learned:
Improved my understanding of CSS layout and positioning
Developed my skills in creating responsive designs that work across different devices
Enhanced my attention to detail in recreating a well-known interface
